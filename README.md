# US Covid19 Statistics
        
There is a great need in the world at the moment because of the Covid-19 pandemic. There are many different opinions on how to respond to Covid, but very few of these policies are based on their effectiveness. The focus has been more on what your enemies are proposing and to stop them or what your friends are supporting and support them. There is little room for analyzing the effectiveness of different policies. This is especially unfortunate because we have months of data about a wide range of policies and nobody seems to be using them.
	
This project intends to be a nexus for information relevant to understanding the effectiveness of policies related to covid. We will collect information about deaths, infections and population density in states and counties. We will also find policy makers for each of the geographic areas and what policies they have made at what time. For every piece of information on this database, there will be a source attached to allow it to be traced back to its source.
	
We are looking for a team of 2. We are leaning towards using a key-value database for our NoSQL implementation. For the more technical parts of our project, we will be using a website to present the database. We will be hosting the website and database on a server somewhere (TBD). We are looking at using MySQL for our relational database.
		
For the business side of this project, this will be a non-profit project. I don’t want this project to be biased because of where it’s funding comes from.
	
For legal matters, I will only be using public sources so there shouldn’t be any problem with disclosing classified information
